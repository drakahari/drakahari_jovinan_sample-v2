        Thank you for visiting Drakahari Careers. We are excited to have you review this website. This is a sample website application that I have worked on for my Programming and Application Foundations course at Illinois Institute of Technology. I owe a great deal of thanks to aakasshns for posting a very good tutorial that was recommedned to me at freeCodeCamp.org. The Jovian Careers tutorial was very useful when trying to understand full-stack development. I was able to get hands on experience with bootstap, html, css, json, python (Flask framework), sqlalchemy and javascript. I was able to learn a lot about the basics of python and how to use it in a real world scenario of a web application. being able to GET and POST data to/from a database and troubleshoot the issues as they arise has been very valuable. Most notably, I learned a great deal about version control (important to hide password credentials...), database creation, database migration, and database qeuries. I had to make several edits to my code in order to get the database features to work as intedned with my azure cloud database.
