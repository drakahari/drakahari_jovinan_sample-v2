            <p>I owe a great deal of thanks to aakasshns for posting a very good tutorial that was recommended to me at <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a>. You can check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBDHkveJUf4" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> for more information. The Jovian Careers tutorial was very useful when trying to understand full-stack development. I kept many of the elements that were presented in that tutorial as it helped me navigate errors in the code and to get a better handle on how to format my python route calls.</p>

            <p>I was able to get hands-on experience with bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JSON, Python (Flask framework), SQLAlchemy, and JavaScript. I learned a lot about the basics of Python and how to use it in a real-world scenario of a web application. Being able to GET and POST data to/from a database and troubleshoot issues as they arise has been very valuable.</p>

            <p>Most notably, I learned a great deal about version control (important to hide password credentials...), database creation, database migration, environment variables and database queries. I had to make several edits to my code in order to get the database features to work as intended with my Azure cloud database.</p>

            <p>I am also grateful for a fantastic tutorial that I watched on Youtube from a creator Brian Design at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FazgJVnrVuI" target="_blank">YouTube video</a>. This allowed me to get significant practice at entering code by hand for an entire styles.css file. I also kept the images and format very close to what was presented to better enable debugging and troubleshooting.</p>

          <p>I am also grateful for the help that AI provided with this project. I was able to utilize Copilot to check my code and to help organize the code as it evolved. This is a very powerful tool that also helped me figure out proper database calls and python route navigation for my linked pages.</p>
